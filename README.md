# oh-my-zsh-custom

These are Andrew Janke's customizations to go with [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) ("OMZ").

This includes:

* Stuff in pending Pull Requests for the main OMZ but I want active now
* My themes
* Alternate versions of things for testing

This is hosted on GitHub so other people working on oh-my-zsh can look at it when testing code, and so I can easily sync it to multiple machines of mine. This is not intended to provide significant functionality or reusable code of value. You probably do not want to use this as your own OMZ custom dir unless you're working an OMZ issue with me.

No support of any kind is provided for this code.

## Stuff currently included

Code from these pending PRs is currently in here:

* Timebox git status calls
 * https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/pull/3914
* Clean up spectrum.zsh to avoid junking terminal
  * https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/pull/3965
  * https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/pull/3966
* omz_diagnostic_dump() function to help debugging
  * https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/pull/3940
* A bit of stuff (but not the majority) from theme support unification
  * https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/pull/3743

TODO:

* Terminal.app support in main termsupport
 * https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/pull/3582

## Usage

By convention, I clone this locally to `~/.oh-my-zsh-custom`, but any location will work. `$ZSH_CUSTOM` must be pointed at this in `~/.zshrc` before initializing OMZ.
